## Sass File Structure

[A Simple SCSS Architecture, and Best Practice Playbook - by Matthew Elsom](https://matthewelsom.com/blog/simple-scss-playbook.html)

* abstracts - helper functions and non-output code (font-face, global variables, colors, mixins)

* base - global styles including resets, typography, global tags (ex. body, html)

* components - micro level re-usable components that each do one thing only. Each sass file contains all component styles, variations and states

* layouts - unique combinations of components and base styles. Contains component overrides and specific layout attributes
